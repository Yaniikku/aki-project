# Spam or Ham Classifier

## Overview
This project is a **Spam or Ham Classifier** designed to distinguish between spam and legitimate (ham) messages. The goal is to build a robust classification system by experimenting with various machine learning models and techniques, fine-tuning them, and comparing their performance to identify the best approach.

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Comparative analysis of models to determine the most effective classifier.

## Models and Techniques
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Deep Learning Models (e.g., LSTM, Transformers)**
- Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yaniikku/aki-project.git
    ```

## Results
The project includes a detailed comparison of model performance based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
